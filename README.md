# 👋 Howdy, I'm Olukayode Soliu!

Hey there! I'm a Blockchain Developer, Software Engineer, and all-around tech enthusiast who's just recently decided to get **serious** about this GitHub thing. Yeah, it took me a while, but better late than never, right? 🚀

## 🚧 **Under Construction Since August**
I know, I know—GitHub isn't new, but consider this my grand awakening. I've finally gotten around to building my repositories (yep, the ones I've been talking about since forever) and sharing my journey in the world of **Web3, blockchain, and smart contracts**.

### 🛠️ My Superpowers (aka Skills)
When I’m not battling spaghetti code, you can find me doing some cool stuff like:
- 🧠 Writing **smart contracts** with **Solidity** and **Rust**
- 💻 Developing web apps using **JavaScript**, **React**, **Node.js**, **HTML/CSS**
- 🎨 Creating iOS magic with **Swift**, **Kotlin**, and **SwiftUI**
- 🌐 Managing **GraphQL** and **SQL** databases
- 📈 Crafting and deploying **Decentralized Applications (dApps)**

### ⚡ Fun Facts About Me
- 🌱 I’m into **green energy**—because saving the planet while coding sounds like a good plan.
- 🎮 I’m an **iOS Engineer** who loves solving complex problems with simple solutions (hello, Swift!).
- 👨‍💻 I founded **Blvck Code LLC**—we do cool things with code, promise!
